# Facial-expression-recognition
We apply machine learning and CNN's to a video to recognize the facial expressions in the video. After training, the model is served to a web interface to perform real time facial recognition.

The whole training set and test set along with the testing videos cannot be uploaded here, you just need to download images and separate them into folders and put them into the training and test folders.
